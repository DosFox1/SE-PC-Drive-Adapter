# SE PC Driver Adapter 
A small board to interface between the 26 way connector on the SE PC Drive Card, and the actual Macintosh 5.25" PC Drive. 

# So, What Is It?
Pretty much does what it says on the tin. 
Replaces the cable if you don't have it (or don't want to solder 20+ connections). 

**NOTE - THIS HAS NOT BEEN TESTED**
